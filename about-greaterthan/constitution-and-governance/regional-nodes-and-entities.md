# ðŸŽ† Regional nodes & entities

Greaterthan is a remote-first collective, with members scattered across the globe, and many of them being without a fixed permanent residence. Therefore we have always aimed to find flexible structures that can meet the needs of people in many locations, while also creating regional entities when deemed necessary. &#x20;

**Greaterthan currently operates through two legal entities:**&#x20;

* [Greaterthan Collective Ltd (UK):](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11387616) our "mother entity" that is used for the majority of our global operations | founded May 2018
* [Greaterthan Collective Aotearoa Ltd (New Zealand)](https://newzealand-company.com/co/greaterthan-collective-aotearoa-limited): our first regional entity | founded September 2021

### When and why do we create additional Greaterthan entities?&#x20;

For us, legal structures are a means to an end and should not be drivers of how to organize and govern our collective. Therefore we apply the principle of only creating new legal entities only when there is a clear and strong need for them (rather than _anticipating_ the need or having the wish for a certain governance). Some of the reasons for creating a country specific entity may be having a critical mass of active members or clients in one location, running a large amount of in-person activities (events, retreats) in one place that require VAT registration, or gaining access to grant and funding opportunities. &#x20;
