# ðŸŽ† Regional nodes & entities

Greaterthan currently operates through two legal entities:&#x20;

* [Greaterthan Collective Ltd (UK):](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11387616) our "mother entity" that is used for the majority of our global operations | founded May 2018
* [Greaterthan Collective Aotearoa Ltd (New Zealand)](https://newzealand-company.com/co/greaterthan-collective-aotearoa-limited): our first regional entity | founded September 2021

### When and why do we create additional Greaterthan entities?&#x20;

We see legal structures as a means to an end and apply the principle of only creating new legal vehicles when there is a clear need for them (rather than the anticipation of a need). Reasons for creating a country specific entity may be having a critical mass of active members or clients in that location, geographically focused in-person activities (events, retreats) that would benefit from , gaining access to grants&#x20;
