# Values & Guiding Principles

## We're greater than the sum of our parts.

**Our values apply equally to how we work both externally and internally \(because we don't see them as being different\).** 

### Authenticity & Integrity

We make an effort to understand and honor the origins of the concepts and practices we work on, while being honest with ourselves that we will always be learning.

### Collaboration

We believe that change will come from people and organizations collaborating and doing business together in an ecosystem. We're committed to ongoing personal development because we believe it enhances impact. **We are greater than the sum of our parts.**

### Openness

Openness means many things for us. Open communication is a fertile ground for learning and personal development. It also means keeping a balance between three approaches to developing and sharing knowledge: publicly, within the commons of our ecosystem and privately.

### Value Created &gt; Value Extracted

What drives us in our work is to make a positive contribution to the world.   
Greaterthan is built around value creation for all stakeholders: the planet, society, our workers and our customers.

### Holistic Approach

On an individual level, everyone should be able to bring their full, authentic self to what they do.    
On an organizational level, we think systemically.
