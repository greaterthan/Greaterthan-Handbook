## Stewardship-ownership

**Greaterthan is a Stewardship-Owned Company**, with a [Golden Share Model. ](http://steward-ownership.com/elementor-122/)As described by Purpose Fund, stewardship-owned businesses have two key characteristics: 

* **Entrepreneurship = Ownership:** Steward-ownership ensures that the control of the company is not a commodity anymore. The steering wheel – the majority of the voting rights – of self-determined companies lies in hands of people who are connected to the mission of the company.
* **Profits are a means to an end:** With steward-ownership profits are a means to an end, not an end in itself. Instead profits directly serve the purpose of the company. They are used to pay back investors, re-invested in the company, or donated to charity.​

To ensure that our commitment to these principles is upheld and cannot be changed, the charitable [Purpose Foundation](https://purpose-economy.org/en/) holds a "Guardian Share" in our company with veto-power.

## Articles of Association

BACKGROUND

1. The Company exists to promote a world where workplaces are communities that provide agency, personal growth and meaning.
2. The Company was founded on principles of shared purpose, values and commitment, as well as co-ownership, steward-ownership, non-domination, subsidiarity and open communication.
3. The Company has been structured in a way that is consistent with the above. It has an embedded purpose beyond profit, and an ownership structure that distributes control amongst the active participants.

PURPOSE OF COMPANY

1. Purposes
   1. The purposes of the Company are to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members and, through its business and operations, to have a material positive impact on society and the environment, taken as a whole. In particular, the Company shall run a business that aims to create a world where workplaces are communities that provide agency, personal growth and meaning.
   2. A director shall have regard \(amongst other matters\) to:
2. 1. 1. the likely consequences of any decision in the long term,
      2. the interests of the Company's employees and contractors,
      3. the need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others,
      4. the impact of the Company's operations on the communities and ecosystems it is part of, and the environment,
      5. the desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and
      6. the need to act fairly as between members of the Company,

\(together, the matters referred to above shall be defined for the  purposes of this Article as the "Stakeholder Interests"\).

1. 1. For the purposes of a director’s duty to act in the way he or she considers, in good faith, most likely to promote the success of the Company, a director shall not be required to regard the benefit of any particular Stakeholder Interest or group of Stakeholder Interests as more important than any other.
   2. Nothing in this Article express or implied, is intended to or shall create or grant any right or any cause of action to, by or for any person \(other than the Company\).
2. Principles
   1. Shared commitments over individuality: The Company emphasises maximum freedom \(for individuals\) and maximum cohesion \(for the business as a whole\). Co-owners are not held together not by employment contracts but by a shared purpose, shared values and a shared commitment.
   2. Non-domination: No participant, or group of participants should be able to dominate discussions or control decisions. For this reason, we avoid voting in making decisions.  This doesn’t mean that all decisions need to be made by consensus or that everyone will be happy with the decisions that are made, but the process should be fair and unbiased.
   3. Co-ownership and steward-ownership:  The Company should be ultimately owned and led by those actively and regularly engaged in it, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of those most involved in or affected by the activities of the business \(customers, associates and the wider community\). Entrepreneurship equals decision-making power.  The earning of profits is a means to the achievement of the purpose of the company and not an end in itself. Profits of the company will be either reinvested into the company, invested in projects which serve the Purpose or donated to charity.
   4. Subsidiarity: The ethos of our decision making is to delegate all responsibility for operational decision making to the body with the closest direct connection to the decision within our structure.  
   5. Open Communication: Participants practise open, honest communication with each other to create a transparent and trusting work environment.
