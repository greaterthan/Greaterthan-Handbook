# Project Setup & Overview

**What do we mean by project?** A project is anything being worked on under the Greaterthan banner, such as consulting, training, coaching, product sales with external clients, as well as internal GT initiatives, such as our academy, org development and more. 

### What projects are we working on right now? 

 As a member, you can see the overview of our ongoing projects in the following Airtable links \(if you don't have access yet, ask in \#admin channel\):

* [External client projects](https://airtable.com/tblZj0i7cL9HfcS8k/viwpXOt2puTwkKsRt?blocks=hide) 
* [Internal projects ](https://airtable.com/tblwigpNola4cH8bo/viweiSLGBvgqvKt67?blocks=hide)

### Setting up a new project in the GT system

We have a simple process for setting up a new external project, that can be carried out by any GT member. While it's great if all our external projects --both paid and pro bono-- can be setup with this process, **the following steps are mandatory for paid projects using the GT legal vehicle**. This is a prerequisite to be able to invoice a client through GT!
