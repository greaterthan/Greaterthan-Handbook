# Decision process for new GT courses

### Intentions & aims of this process

* The academy should be the #1 place that GT members bring their courses (rather than running them separately)
* The process for doing so should be kept light and autonomous
* For now, we want to avoid needing a dedicated curation team&#x20;

### **Requirements for running a course**

* Only associates and partners can propose courses
* The course must be aligned with GT’s purpose and our north star
* The proposer must have participated in at least one multi-week course of ours, to get an understanding of our approach
* Courses are expected to follow the pricing guidelines provided (to be created) to ensure that our prices are coherent
* Before putting up a date for your course, check what else is scheduled and look [at our annual rhythms calendar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DidmNV8BGwjigoMue266G0b7azo5pKh9/view?usp=sharing), to avoid conflicts
* After running the course, you are expected to share with the group feedback about how it went

### **How it works**&#x20;

We have setup [this Loomio thread](https://www.loomio.org/d/o2qwuRbM/proposing-new-gt-courses-decisions-thread) where all proposals for new courses live and this process runs.

1. To propose a new course, **add a decision to the** [**existing thread,**](https://www.loomio.org/d/o2qwuRbM/proposing-new-gt-courses-decisions-thread) **** sharing key info about the course and why they want to run it (see info and template below)
2. Then feedback from GT members is collected and a lazy consent decision run, open for 2 weeks, to approve it
3. Once approved, the proposer sets up the course page, and chooses the first date (or starts collecting interest, if they are not ready to set a date yet)
{% endhint %}

### **What should the proposal include?**&#x20;

Use this template to fill out when making a proposal that includes:

* Course title + description
* Length + format&#x20;
* Target audience of the course
* Pricing&#x20;
* How you see this course being aligned with GT’s purpose

### **Recommendations for proposers**

* Don’t host alone
* Get advice from GT members who have run multiple courses, especially about sales expectations&#x20;
* Wait to set a date until you have some indication of the level of interest for your course, and ideally ‘warmed up’ a few people that are ready to buy. The idea behind this is to avoid launching a course, having a few signups but not enough to run it, and then having to cancel on those who registered. This is a bad user experience for participants, and not fun for the hosts either.

### **Relationship between GT and your course**

* 15 % of all course revenue goes to the GT commons budget
* You are expected to ensure promotion and sales of your course. We currently don’t offer dedicated marketing support. What you can expect though is:&#x20;
  * The course will be announced in our weekly newsletter, the Weekender &#x20;
  * You will have access to our email marketing tool Active Campaign to be able to build a segment and send targeted emails
  * You will have access to our social media platforms, if you wish to use them for communicating&#x20;
  * We will share basic resources for course marketing you can reuse and build on
