# Working Together

## Rhythms & Rituals

### Weekly GT Member meetings

We alternative between two meeting types every two weeks for all partners and associates: 

1. Sense-Making, Tensions & Proposals
2. New Projects, Project updates & Biz Dev

To see when these calls are scheduled, please check the GT Team Meetings google calendar, which you were given access to when onboarded.

### In-person Sprints <a id="in-person-sprints"></a>

3-5 days of living & working together with the whole team in rotating \(rural\) locations, every 3-6 months.

### Ecosystem & Learning Calls

Every few months we host open calls with associates and people we work with to discuss and share learning on a certain topic.

## **Etiquette for going offline & availabilities**

* If you cannot join a regular meeting, decline the calendar invite. 
* Share your calendar with other team members, and put your location in it so that everyone knows where you are
* Add "OFF - \[location\]" in your calendar when you are offline
