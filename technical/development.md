# Development

## Comms
  * We use Slack for day to day comms
  * Our tickets live in Github
  * We have 2x weekly standsups and bi-weekly sprint planning.
  * We plan to add waffle.io integration.  

## Tickets
* We are learning the right scoping process for our tickets. As a start, please include _who_, _what_ and _why_ in tickets and issues, and as possible focus on user stories so that tickets include some user-facing result. 

## Branch structure, naming and other norms
* When a project has a `api` repo and a corresponding `ui` repo, if you are making changes inb oth, sync names between them. 

## Code review
* For each ticket, use a pull request when it's ready to have someone else look at the code.
* Two sets of eyes on each contribution so that multiple people are familiar with new code.
* As appropriate ask someone who didn't write the code to do a UI/useabilty review

## Tests
* Ideally a different person than the primary writer of a feature should write the corresponding test
