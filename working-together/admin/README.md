# Admin & Finance

All our basic admin procedures are explained [**in this map**](https://www.mindmeister.com/1195542438?t=LYHjk2g2DM)**,** such as submitting expenses, creating invoices, making budgets, project management etc.

## Invoicing

General speaking, project leaders are expected to make their own invoices for their clients. 

If you cannot make an invoice yourself in Xero, please **send the following information to admin@greaterthan.works:** 

* **Customer:** Name and full Billing Info \(Address, Company or VAT number if available\)
* **Amount:** Billing currency and total billing amount
* **Tax:** including VAT/ excluding VAT, no VAT at all? 
* **Description:** Product / Service Details 
* **Payment deadline**: standard is 14 days, please indicate if it should vary
* **How to send the invoice:** indicate whether you would like it sent directly through Xero \(in that case provide an email\), or whether you need a PDF.  

## Accounting Tracking codes & Business Units

We use a tracking system in Xero to manage our projects and keep track of where money is coming from and going to.

There are 2 tracking categories:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Tracking Category</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">What it means</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Projects         </b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Where the funds come from.</b><em><br /><br /></em>This can be revenue
        from a certain project, consulting client, but also GT Core, when it invests
        in projects.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Internal</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p><b> Where the funds sit inside GT. </b>
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Internal stands for &quot;Business Units&quot; (BUs). There are several
          types of BUs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Personal BUs</b> for people working through the business</li>
          <li><b>Shrubbery BUs,</b> which are projects that Greaterthan is investing
            in and/or operates separate from the core, i.e Cobudget, Academy, Better
            Work Together.</li>
          <li><b>GT Core BU, </b>which holds all operating costs, consulting budgets
            and surplus (that is then paid out as bonuses or reinvested in projects).</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>**As a general rule, every transaction in Xero must be attributed to the "Internal" category**, so we know where the funds sit. A project tracking code is not always needed, for instance when funds go directly into personal BUs.
