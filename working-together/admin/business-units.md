# Business Units

From a financial perspective, Greaterthan is structured into business units, which are managed as independent entities inside the organization. 

## Types of business units

There are several types of BUs: 

* **Personal BUs** for people working through the business
* **Shrubbery BUs,** which are projects that Greaterthan is investing in and/or operates separate from the core, i.e Cobudget, Academy, Better Work Together.
* **GT Core BU,** which holds all operating costs, consulting budgets and surplus \(that is then paid out as bonuses or reinvested in projects\).

## Who can have a personal business unit

Co-owners

## Starting a new Business Unit

Any co-owner or associate can have a business unit in GT under the following conditions \(BU agreement\): 

* all work invoiced contributes a 15 % to GT core to go towards admin overhead and GT common pot for investing in new projects.
*  the BU is managed responsibly - the amount in it can never be negative. 

To start a new business unit for a Shrubbery, a proposal must be approved by consent in the GT co-owner Loomio.
