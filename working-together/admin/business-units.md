# Business Units

From a financial perspective, Greaterthan is structured into business units, which are managed as independent entities inside the organization. 

## Types of business units

There are several types of BUs: 

* **Personal BUs** for people working through the business
* **Project BUs,** which are for large consulting projects 
* **Shrubbery BUs,** which are projects that Greaterthan is investing in and/or operates separate from the core, i.e Cobudget, Academy, Better Work Together.
* **GT Core BU,** which holds all operating costs, consulting budgets and surplus \(that is then paid out as bonuses or reinvested in projects\).

### Who can have a personal business unit

Personal business units are for co-owners only. 

## Starting a new Business Unit

Personal business units can be created if the owner agrees to the following conditions \(BU agreement\): 

**\#1 All work invoiced contributes 15 % to GT core**, to go towards admin overhead and the GT common pot for investing in new projects, as laid out in our financial agreement.

**\#2 The BU is managed responsibly:** 

* the BU owner ensures they always have sufficient funds to cover incoming costs 
* the amount in the BU shall never be negative
* If funds remain in the BU after the year-end, the 19% UK company tax will automatically be deducted. 

To start a new BU for a Shrubbery, a proposal must be approved by consent in the GT co-owner Loomio.
