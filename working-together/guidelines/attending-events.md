# Attending Events

We are often invited to events to speak and need to decide whether to attend. Here are a few evaluation criteria to help decide whether to say yes or noto an opportunity. 

General principle: Less is more! Fewer high quality events, with high quality contributions from our side is better. 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Criteria</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Questions to ask</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b> 1. Financial viability                </b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Is the gig paid?</p>
        <p>Is it in a location you need to go anyways and can cover your travel expenses
          to get there?</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>2. Topical &amp; strategic aligment </b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>How aligned are the topics and audience of the event with our current
          focus? Will you be able to learn something new on subjects that are in
          the current focus?</p>
        <p>Will you be able to meet people that are strategic for your current projects?</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>3. Stategic relationships</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Is it strategic to build a good relationship with the organization running
        the event, because we want to partner in the future or want to support
        the mission?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>4. PR &amp; Visibility</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Are we currently actively trying to promote something this will give us
        an opportunity for? How big will the audience be /are talks being filmed
        or streamed?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>5. Logistics &amp; footprint</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">How complicated will it be to get there (how much of your energy will
        it take)? If it&apos;s a far trip, can you connect it with other things?
        Is the opportunity worth the enviromental footprint?</td>
