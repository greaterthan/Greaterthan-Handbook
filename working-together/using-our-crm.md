# Using our CRM \(Customer Relationship Management\)

The reason we are using a CRM in the Greaterthan team is for all of us to:

* get an overview of who is/ was talking to which customer or partner
* track follow ups and other actions related to customers and partner organizations
* see in one glance the status of our pipeline 

### Getting set up on Agile CRM

The tool we are using is Agile CRM: [https://greaterthan.agilecrm.com/](https://greaterthan.agilecrm.com/)

1. To join, ask Francesca to add you to our team. 
2. Sync Agile CRM with your Greaterthan email address, so that your contacts sync automatically and you can see your emails with them directly in the system. 

Do this by clicking on the upper right hand corner on **"Settings":**

Then click in the left hand bar on** "Email"**. Here you can connect your Gmail account under **"Inbound" **\(outbound is not really necessary\) .  ![](/assets/agilecrm2.png)
