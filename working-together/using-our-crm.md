# Using our CRM \(Customer Relationship Management\)

The reason we are using a CRM in the Greaterthan team is for all of us to:

* get an overview of who is/ was talking to which customer or partner and have all their information in one place
* track follow ups and other actions related to customers and partner organizations
* see in one glance the status of our pipeline 

### Getting set up on Agile CRM

The tool we are using is Agile CRM: [https://greaterthan.agilecrm.com/](https://greaterthan.agilecrm.com/)

1. To join, ask Francesca to add you to our team. 
2. Sync Agile CRM with your Greaterthan email address, so that your contacts sync automatically and you can see your emails with them directly in the system. 

Do this by clicking on the upper right hand corner on **"Settings":**

Then click in the left hand bar on** "Email"**. Here you can connect your Gmail account under **"Inbound" **\(outbound is not really necessary\) .  ![](/assets/agilecrm2.png)

3. Add your contacts! Here is how:

### Adding & Managing Contacts

There are a few easy ways to add or edit contacts to Agile CRM by installing the Agile CRM Widget for your browser.

[**&gt;&gt; Download Browser Widget**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/agile-crm/eofoblinhpjfhkjlfckmeidagfogclib?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog)

From this widget, you can add tasks, deals and new contacts easily, but also access some features by right clicking when in Gmail.

If your email account is synched, contacts will automatically be added once a day to the CRM. However, if you would like to manually add your contacts from inside Gmail, especially from other email addresses that are not synched with Agile CRM, you can do this by right clicking when you select the email address. ![](/assets/agilecontacts.png)

When you select **"search email on Agile CRM"**, there will be a popup that let's you add this person's further details. 

### Organizations

Each contact can be attributed to an organization, which is our second database in Agile CRM. When you create a new organization, you need to categorize it by Cobudget Use Case & Type, which will help us filter later on and do targeted outreach. 

**Tagging: **please add any relevant tags to organizations and contacts that will help us find them later. You can add as many as you like, and it makes sense to include tags for things such as: event where you met them, topic they are focused on \(i.e. blockchain\), more details on the org type \(i.e. coworking space\)

### Our Pipeline & Deals

You can find the pipeline in the left hand bar. This is where we add all potential deals in our pipeline, as they come in, so we can have an overview and track follow ups. Please make sure to always attribute a deal to a contact and /or an organization.  ![](/assets/agilecrm4.png)
