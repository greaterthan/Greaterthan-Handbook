# ðŸ’¬ Communication Tools

Here is an overview of the communications tools our team currently uses. To avoid tool overload, we usually onboard people to them on a needs basis, depending on the projects they are working on!

## Who can be added to these tools and how?&#x20;

To get access to any of these tools, please ask any of the partners to be added.

**The majority of our tools are available for anyone working on our projects** on a needs basis. There are certain tools reserved to associates and partners only, such as Loomio, for formal decision-making.&#x20;
