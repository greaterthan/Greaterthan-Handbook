# 💬 Communication Practices & Tools

## Practices

Here you can find principles and guiding questions that help us with our communications practices in Greaterthan, specifically mediated communication (typed, audio, video; not live conversations).&#x20;

To see a collection of useful practices and tips from members, as well as a directory of key slack channels and their purpose, check out[ **this living document.** ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rv3AmyaScdLA\_5edVn4n7mLb6P-k11\_I5ChsXlQ8A\_0/edit)

### **A few communication principles**



1. **Personal responsibility:** We are all responsible for (1) how we communicate and (2) how we keep ourselves informed on what is going on in GT. In a complex system with a lot of humans, we can’t expect to be able to follow everything at all times; so being explicit about our capacity helps us all. Ask yourself: What do I need others to know? What do I really need to follow?&#x20;
2. **The sum of our individual attention is a precious collective resource**. Let’s treat it as such! Ask yourself: Who is the must-see audience for my message?
3. **We’re all role models:** How we communicate is a role model for communications across the system, especially for new joiners. Ask yourself: What would happen if everyone communicated the way I did?&#x20;
4. **Communicate purpose:** When you start a new space for discussion (a new channel in Slack, Loomio thread, etc.), make explicit the purpose of it; for instance by always adding a channel description. Ask yourself: How can others find out why we are having this conversation and what is the expected outcome?
5. **Check for redundancy.** Ask yourself: Has someone else already started this conversation somewhere else, that I can build on?&#x20;
6. **Show that you’re paying attention.** Acknowledgement keeps information flowing, and helps the collective tune into what’s attracting energy. Ask yourself: How would I like to let the sender know that and how their message was received. How can I provide the information they need to move forward? Examples: emoji reactions or responding to and updating calendar invites.

## Tools

Here is an overview of the communications tools our team currently uses. To avoid tool overload, we usually onboard people to them on a needs basis, depending on the projects they are working on!

## Who can be added to these tools and how?&#x20;

To get access to any of these tools, please ask any of the partners to be added.

**The majority of our tools are available for anyone working on our projects** on a needs basis. There are certain tools reserved to associates and partners only, such as Loomio, for formal decision-making.&#x20;
