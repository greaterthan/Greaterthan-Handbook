# Invoicing Guidelines

## **General invoicing & payment principles** 

### **Invoicing clients**

**Who makes invoices for clients**? Project leaders \(whom are mostly co-owners\) are expected to make their own invoices for their clients. We use the accounting software [Xero](http://xero.co) to make our invoices, and all co-owners receive access to our account to be able to create and send invoices. 

**What currency to invoice the client in?** Our preference for invoicing clients is in Pounds, Euros or NZD. USD, AU and CAD are possible as well, with CAD only being in exceptions. 

**Payment deadlines:** our standard payment schedule is 14-30 days. This may be different on a per client basis.

### Payment of contractors

**What currency to invoice in?** You can currently invoice in Pounds, Euros, NZD or USD. Other currencies may be possible upon request, since we use Transferwise. If possible, **please always make invoices out in the currency that your bank account is in** \(to avoid unnecessary exchange fees\). 

**Exchange fees**: When applicable and unless agreed otherwise, exchange fees are paid by the contractor.

**Payment deadlines:** payments to contractors are generally made once a month, on the 15th, and only after the client has paid. There can be exceptions to this on a case by case basis, which need to be signed off by a co-owner.

### Use of tracking codes

We use a tracking system in Xero to manage our projects and keep track of where money is coming from and going to. Each large project has its own tracking code. Short, 1-off projects are categorized as "other consulting". 

If you are starting a new large project, check with Francesca to create a new tracking code for it. 

#### Overview of the tracking codes and how to use them

There are 2 tracking categories:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Tracking Category</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">What it means</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Projects         </b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Where the funds come from.</b><em><br /><br /></em>This can be revenue
        from a certain project, consulting client, but also GT Core, when it invests
        in projects.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><b>Internal</b>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p><b> Where the funds sit inside GT. </b>
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Internal stands for &quot;Business Units&quot; (BUs). <a href="business-units.md">See more details about BU types and how they work.</a>
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As a general rule, **every transaction in Xero must be attributed to the "Internal" category**, so we know where the funds sit. A project tracking code is not always needed, for instance when funds go directly into personal BUs. 

**When making your invoice, please make sure to fill in both tracking categories.**

### Taxes

Greaterthan is registered for UK VAT. This has the following implications when invoicing clients: 

* add UK VAT when invoicing another UK business 
* For invoices to businesses in all other European countries, we use the **Reverse Charge.**  This means that you don't have to add VAT but use the code "Zero Rated EC Services/Goods". Before applying this rule, check with the client on whether it applies in their country.
* For services in countries outside the EU, there is no VAT.

If you have further questions about tax on invoices, ask Francesca. 

### Invoice Templates for different currencies

When making an invoice in Xero, you will see that there are different templates \(called "Branding" for invoicing in different currencies. [Watch this quick tutorial on how to use our templates. ](https://www.loom.com/share/e3e3da1bccf4437fa305d3ff73335428)

If you're invoicing with reverse charge, use the template "EU reverse charge", which includes the reverse charge clause automatically.

If you need to make an invoice for a client and do not have a Xero account, please **send the following information to admin@greaterthan.works:** 

* **Customer:** Name and full Billing Info \(Address, Company or VAT number if available\)
* **Amount:** Billing currency and total billing amount
* **Tax:** including VAT/ excluding VAT, no VAT at all? 
* **Description:** Product / Service Details 
* **Payment deadline**: standard is 14 days, please indicate if it should vary
* **How to send the invoice:** indicate whether you would like it sent directly through Xero \(in that case provide an email\), or whether you need a PDF.
