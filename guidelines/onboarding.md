# Onboarding

## Onboarding new ecosystem members

Onboarding in Greaterthan is mostly distributed. It is the responsibility of members to onboard and guide people that they have invited. 

Here is our [Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) that GT members can share with new ecosystem members when they join.
