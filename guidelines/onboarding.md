# Onboarding

## Onboarding new ecosystem members

Onboarding in Greaterthan is mostly distributed. It is the responsibility of members to onboard and guide people that they have invited. 

Two most important onboarding steps: 

1. When a new ecosystem member is added, **send them the** [**Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation. 
2. Please **add them to this** [**People Dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cqVmoV0AtcExdkr3vpl5oKBTFng4njT1uVzgWvooA4c/edit#gid=0) with their basic info and who invited them, so we can keep track. 
3. Let members know! Send a message on the \#gt-members slack channel announcing this person has joined. 
4. Welcome them on the \#everyone channel of the GT slack

## Onboarding associates

Onboarding of new associates is the responsibility of the GT member who invited in and put up the decisions to bring in this new person. 

To onboard an associate: 

1. If they have not seen it yet when they joined ecosystem, share with them the ****[**Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation. 
2. **Update their info on the** [**People Dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cqVmoV0AtcExdkr3vpl5oKBTFng4njT1uVzgWvooA4c/edit#gid=0)**,** by changing their status and updating who invited them.
3. **Add them to tools:** You can use the checklist of tools in the people dashboard to make sure they get added to all relevant channels - Loomio, \#GT-members channel, Shared Drives and Shared Calendars. 
4. **Welcome them!** Send a message on the \#gt-members slack channel to welcome them there.
