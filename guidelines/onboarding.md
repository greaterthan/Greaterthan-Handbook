# Onboarding

## Onboarding new ecosystem members

Onboarding in Greaterthan is mostly distributed. It is the responsibility of members to onboard and guide people that they have invited. 

Two most important onboarding resources: 

1. When a new ecosystem member is added, **send them the** [**Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation. 
2. Please **add them to this** [**People Dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cqVmoV0AtcExdkr3vpl5oKBTFng4njT1uVzgWvooA4c/edit#gid=0) with their basic info and who invited them, so we can keep track.
