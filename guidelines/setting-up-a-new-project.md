# Setting up a new project

We have a simple process for setting up a new project, that can be carried out by any GT member. 

While it's great if all our projects --both internal and external, volunteer and paid-- can be setup with this process, **the following steps are mandatory for paid projects using the GT legal vehicle**. This is a prerequisite to be able to invoice a client through GT! 

**What do we mean by project?** In this context, a project is anything being worked on under the Greaterthan banner, such as consulting, training, coaching, product sales etc. Most of the time this refers to projects with external clients that need to be invoiced, but it also includes internal GT initiatives.  

## The steps to setting up your project

Setting up a project works in a few minutes by filling out a form. 

1. \*\*\*\*[**Add your project by filling out this Airtable Form**](https://airtable.com/shrWUIN9f0eu8vTZi)\*\*\*\*
2. If you have not previously added them, [add the client and their billing information with this form](https://airtable.com/shrmKq7Iosp3pbWDA). 

That's it! You can see the [overview of all ongoing projects in our Airtable](https://airtable.com/tblZj0i7cL9HfcS8k/viwpXOt2puTwkKsRt?blocks=hide) \(if you don't have access yet, ask in \#admin channel\).
