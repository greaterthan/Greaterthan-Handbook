#### Onboarding...

## Explorers

Explorer onboarding in Greaterthan is a distributed accountability among those who make invitations. If you as a member invite someone as an explorer, you are accountable for ensuring they are correctly onboarded and guided into GT as described below. _To learn about the invitation process for explorers, see the_[ _People Agreement._](../agreements/people-agreement.md#explorers)&#x20;

### Paths to explorer onboarding&#x20;

Since [November 2022](https://www.loomio.com/d/3qmYIa7s/onboarding-explorers-in-cohorts), we have been experimenting with multi-annual _**onboarding cohorts**_. You can now choose when inviting an explorer whether they join immediately and are onboarded by you (the inviter), or whether they wait for the next cohort before joining.&#x20;

**Step 1:** This takes place right after the decision for the explorer to be invited has been closed (see our our [People Agreement](../agreements/people-agreement.md#joining-and-leaving-greaterthan) for how this decision is made).&#x20;

* [ ] The person who invited them [**fills out this form,** ](https://airtable.com/shrsRwYaxNOLaN46o)which adds them to our People Dashboard. This is when you specify whether they are joining immediately or waiting for the next cohort. The person will then appear in [this list ](https://airtable.com/app9eFED6mT3xijkm/pagZJ5UUwGsDt2ujA?Pllch=recKNegH60TXvnqzG)of new and future explorers.&#x20;

**Step 2:** Below is a checklist of what needs to happen for an explorer to be fully onboarded into Greaterthan. Completing these is the accountability of the person who invited them.&#x20;

* [ ] Send them the [Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation.&#x20;
* [ ] Invite them to a few key tools. Please make sure to go to the [People Dashboard - Tools & Onboarding, ](https://airtable.com/app9eFED6mT3xijkm/pagZJ5UUwGsDt2ujA)find their name and then tick off all the tools you have invited them to:&#x20;
  1. the Greaterthan **slack team**. When logged in, you can do so with [this link. ](https://greaterfinance.slack.com/admin/invites)
  2. the **open GT events calendar.** Add them to the calendar with their email, with the rights to "make changes to events".
  3. the **GT free Airtable account** (to give them edit access to the "People of Greaterthan" Airtable base). [_More info on how to do this._ ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qxa1fWOnZw7emMDMz-DHXMNzclQ9VMdMWHvCJ8RUF8M/edit)
* [ ] Ask them to find their profile on the [People of Greaterthan 'People Profiles' section](https://airtable.com/app9eFED6mT3xijkm/pagWBlHlsH6y1kzeN?6iIC3=recQTeuAsbK6etMJC), and fill out their profile.&#x20;
* [ ] Let everyone know they have joined! Welcome them on the #everyone channel of the GT slack and ask them to introduce themselves.&#x20;

**After new explorers have completed the onboarding cohort,** ensure their status is changed in our Open Books People list, to "Explorer". This removes them from the ['cohort onboarding list' ](https://airtable.com/app9eFED6mT3xijkm/pagZJ5UUwGsDt2ujA?Pllch=rec9kT2iaiaTymIkA)and indicates that they are now fully onboarded.

### About onboarding cohorts&#x20;

* HOSTING: a rotating team of 2 GT members hosts each onboarding cohort. The responsibility to find the hosts lies with the group of members that invited the people in that cohort.&#x20;
* WHO IS IN THE NEXT COHORT? See who is in the queue for the next onboarding cohort [**here.** ](https://airtable.com/app9eFED6mT3xijkm/pagZJ5UUwGsDt2ujA?Pllch=rec9kT2iaiaTymIkA)
* WHEN: the rhythm of cohorts is still being experimented with. You can find the upcoming start dates in the GT open meetings & events calendar, and in the onboarding queue.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Associates

The GT member who invited in and put up the decision to bring in a new associate is accountable for **setting in motion their onboarding.** The onboarding itself is now done by our persistent role, the "Movement Guide" (currently held by Francesca). All you need to do is follow these 2 steps:&#x20;

1. **Inform movement guide that the person is ready to be onboarded.** They will ensure the person is added to our tools, the website, recurring meetings and more.&#x20;
2. Send them the link to[ this **onboarding one-pager**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qij7\_XeBFWugVHX0m1mOg7rArwORcWDnkptbYgASLFY/edit)**.**

The movement guide will take it from there, following [this onboarding checklist.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IaLdXaXYWuCAGk-mG3gPXOwAAcJtJxpcDEi0heuGP9U/edit)

#### About Greaterthan email addresses

There are two options for how associates may have a Greaterthan email address:

1. **A full Google Apps Email account:** regular email account, which incurs a monthly fee to GT core. All associates may have such a GT email address, but we ask you to only choose this option if you will really use it (since we are aware that many Associates already have several work emails they use). &#x20;
2. **An alias** (done through a google group), that enables you to _receive_ emails to yourname@greaterthan.works, but does not let you send. This is the default option if you do not choose option 1).

When new members receive the onboarding form, they will be able to choose which email option they prefer.
