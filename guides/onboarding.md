# â›´ On & offboarding

#### Onboarding...

### Explorers

Onboarding in Greaterthan is mostly distributed. It is the responsibility of members to onboard and guide people that they have invited.&#x20;

The most important onboarding steps:&#x20;

1. When a new explorers is added, send them the [Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation.&#x20;
2. Add them to our People Masterlist by **** [**filling out this form**](https://airtable.com/shrsRwYaxNOLaN46o) **** (this does not add them to slack!)
3. **Invite them to our Greaterthan slack team**. When logged in, you can do so with [this link. ](https://greaterfinance.slack.com/admin/invites)
4. Invite them with their email to our **open GT events calendar.**
5. Let everyone know they have joined! Welcome them on the #everyone channel of the GT slack and ask them to introduce themselves.&#x20;

### Associates

The GT member who invited in and put up the decision to bring in a new associate is accountable for **setting in motion their onboarding.** The onboarding itself is now done by our persistent role, the "Movement Guide" (currently held by Francesca). All you need to do is follow these 2 steps:&#x20;

1. **Inform movement guide that the person is ready to be onboarded.** They will ensure the person is added to our tools, the website, recurring meetings and more.&#x20;
2. Send them the link to[ this **onboarding one-pager**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qij7\_XeBFWugVHX0m1mOg7rArwORcWDnkptbYgASLFY/edit)**.**

The movement guide will take it from there, following [this onboarding checklist.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IaLdXaXYWuCAGk-mG3gPXOwAAcJtJxpcDEi0heuGP9U/edit)

#### About Greaterthan email addresses

There are two options for how associates may have a Greaterthan email address:

1. **A full Google Apps Email account:** regular email account, which incurs a monthly fee to GT core. All associates may have such a GT email address, but we ask you to only choose this option if you will really use it (since we are aware that many Associates already have several work emails they use). &#x20;
2. **An alias** (done through a google group), that enables you to _receive_ emails to yourname@greaterthan.works, but does not let you send. This is the default option if you do not choose option 1).

When new members receive the onboarding form, they will be able to choose which email option they prefer.
