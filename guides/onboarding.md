# â›´ On & offboarding

#### Onboarding...

## Attention: under construction!

## Explorers

Explorers onboarding in Greaterthan is mostly distributed. It is the responsibility of members to onboard and guide people that they have invited. To learn about the invitation process for explorers, see the[ People Agreement.](../agreements/people-agreement.md#explorers)&#x20;

### Two stages of explorer onboarding&#x20;

Since [November 2022](https://www.loomio.com/d/3qmYIa7s/onboarding-explorers-in-cohorts), we no longer onboard explorers immediately, but in _**quarterly**_ _**cohorts**_. Therefore there are two key stages of onboarding:&#x20;

**Stage 1:** Right after the decision for the explorer to be invited has been completed.&#x20;

* [ ] The person who invited them [**fills out this form,** ](https://airtable.com/shrsRwYaxNOLaN46o)which adds them to our People Dashboard. The new explorer will now appear in the cohort backlog.&#x20;

**Stage 2:** A few days before they are actually onboarded into the system, through the next onboarding cohort. The below steps might be completed individually by the person who invited them, or by one of the inviters who does it for all members of that cohort.&#x20;

1. Send them the [Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation.&#x20;
2. Invite them to a few key tools:
   1. the Greaterthan **slack team**. When logged in, you can do so with [this link. ](https://greaterfinance.slack.com/admin/invites)
   2. the **open GT events calendar.** Add them to the calendar with their email, with the rights to "make changes to events".
   3. the **GT "People of Greaterthan" Airtable** base as an "editor". [_More info on how to do this._ ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qxa1fWOnZw7emMDMz-DHXMNzclQ9VMdMWHvCJ8RUF8M/edit)__
   4. **Update their status** in our Open Books People list, to remove them from the ['onboarding queue' ](https://airtable.com/app9eFED6mT3xijkm/pagZJ5UUwGsDt2ujA?Pllch=rec9kT2iaiaTymIkA)and indicate that they are now onboarded.
3. Ask them to find themselves on the [People of Greaterthan 'People Profiles' section](https://airtable.com/app9eFED6mT3xijkm/pagWBlHlsH6y1kzeN?6iIC3=recQTeuAsbK6etMJC), and ask them to fill out their profile.&#x20;
4. Let everyone know they have joined! Welcome them on the #everyone channel of the GT slack and ask them to introduce themselves.&#x20;

## Associates

The GT member who invited in and put up the decision to bring in a new associate is accountable for **setting in motion their onboarding.** The onboarding itself is now done by our persistent role, the "Movement Guide" (currently held by Francesca). All you need to do is follow these 2 steps:&#x20;

1. **Inform movement guide that the person is ready to be onboarded.** They will ensure the person is added to our tools, the website, recurring meetings and more.&#x20;
2. Send them the link to[ this **onboarding one-pager**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qij7\_XeBFWugVHX0m1mOg7rArwORcWDnkptbYgASLFY/edit)**.**

The movement guide will take it from there, following [this onboarding checklist.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IaLdXaXYWuCAGk-mG3gPXOwAAcJtJxpcDEi0heuGP9U/edit)

#### About Greaterthan email addresses

There are two options for how associates may have a Greaterthan email address:

1. **A full Google Apps Email account:** regular email account, which incurs a monthly fee to GT core. All associates may have such a GT email address, but we ask you to only choose this option if you will really use it (since we are aware that many Associates already have several work emails they use). &#x20;
2. **An alias** (done through a google group), that enables you to _receive_ emails to yourname@greaterthan.works, but does not let you send. This is the default option if you do not choose option 1).

When new members receive the onboarding form, they will be able to choose which email option they prefer.
