# Onboarding

## Ecosystem members

Onboarding in Greaterthan is mostly distributed. It is the responsibility of members to onboard and guide people that they have invited. 

The most important onboarding steps: 

1. When a new ecosystem member is added, **send them the** [**Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation. 
2. Please **add them in the Ecosystem section of this** [**People Dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cqVmoV0AtcExdkr3vpl5oKBTFng4njT1uVzgWvooA4c/edit#gid=0) with their basic info and who invited them, so we can keep track. 
3. Let members know! Send a message on the \#gt-members slack channel announcing this person has joined. 
4. Welcome them on the \#everyone channel of the GT slack

## Associates

Onboarding of new associates is the responsibility of the GT member who invited in and put up the decisions to bring in this new person. 

To onboard an associate: 

1. If they have not seen it yet when they joined ecosystem, share with them the ****[**Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation. 
2. **Update their info on the** [**People Dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cqVmoV0AtcExdkr3vpl5oKBTFng4njT1uVzgWvooA4c/edit#gid=0)**,** by changing their status and updating who invited them.
3. **To get them added to all our tools** \(as listed in the checklist on the people dashboard\) please connect them with Optimi by emaling tools@greaterthan.works. Then Malcolm or Katrin from Optimi will onboard them. 
4. Add their photo & 150 character bio to the Greaterthan website. You can use this as an opportunity to [**show them how to edit it**](https://www.loom.com/share/635395e805594346b99ad04a3f3ae135) **\[**[**see tutorial**](https://www.loom.com/share/635395e805594346b99ad04a3f3ae135)**\]** themselves \(and [add resources to the Toolkit](https://www.loom.com/share/82b8a78d1c0940929ad56c4eb6f4d513)\). 
5. **Welcome them!** Send a message on the \#gt-members slack channel to welcome them there.
