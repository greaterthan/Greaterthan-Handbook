# Onboarding

## Ecosystem members

Onboarding in Greaterthan is mostly distributed. It is the responsibility of members to onboard and guide people that they have invited. 

The most important onboarding steps: 

1. When a new ecosystem member is added, **send them the** [**Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation. 
2. Please **add them in the Ecosystem section of this** [**People Dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cqVmoV0AtcExdkr3vpl5oKBTFng4njT1uVzgWvooA4c/edit#gid=0) with their basic info and who invited them, so we can keep track. 
3. Let members know! Send a message on the \#gt-members slack channel announcing this person has joined. 
4. Welcome them on the \#everyone channel of the GT slack

## Associates

Onboarding of new associates is the responsibility of the GT member who invited in and put up the decisions to bring in this new person. 

### Onboarding checklist

**Alignment, Communication & Welcoming**

1. [ ] If they have not seen it yet when they joined ecosystem, share with them the ****[**Welcome to Greaterthan slidedeck**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rFSGgnr78lhhy5qUJU2nRUVO1Xro84iDbriAotjiRV0/edit#slide=id.p21) as basic orientation. 
2. [ ] **Add them to** [**our website** team section:](https://greaterthan.works/who-we-are) upload a "action" photo & 150 character bio and their GT email \(see below\). You can use this as an opportunity to [**show them how to edit our website**](https://www.loom.com/share/635395e805594346b99ad04a3f3ae135) **\[**[**see tutorial**](https://www.loom.com/share/635395e805594346b99ad04a3f3ae135)**\]** themselves \(and [add resources to the Toolkit](https://www.loom.com/share/82b8a78d1c0940929ad56c4eb6f4d513)\). 
3. [ ] Introduce them to key places to find our knowledge commons: ****[**our knowledge map**](https://www.mindmeister.com/1008538106)**,** this **handbook** & [Knowledge Commons **drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AMicdnwGdCaEUk9PVA)**.**
4. [ ] **Welcome them:** Add them to the private \#gt-members slack channel & welcome them into the circle!

**Admini-stuff**

1. [ ] **Update their information on the** [**People Dashboard**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cqVmoV0AtcExdkr3vpl5oKBTFng4njT1uVzgWvooA4c/edit#gid=0)**,** by changing their status to associate and updating who invited them.
2. [ ] **To get them added to all our tools** \(as listed in the checklist on the people dashboard\) please connect them with Optimi by sending a direct message on slack to **Malcolm** from Optimi, who will onboard them. 
3. [ ] Check what kind of Greaterthan email address they would like, and let Malcolm know so he can add them
   1. **A full Google Apps Email account:** regular email account, which incurs a monthly fee to GT core. All associates may have such a GT email address, but we ask you to only choose this option if you will really use it \(since we are aware that many Associates already have several work emails they use\).  
   2. **An alias** \(done through a google group\), that enables you to _receive_ emails to yourname@greaterthan.works, but does not let you send. This is the default option if you do not choose option 1\).
