# ðŸŽª Attending Events

We are often invited to events to speak and need to decide whether to attend. Here are a few evaluation criteria to help decide whether to say yes or noto an opportunity.&#x20;

General principle: Less is more! Fewer high quality events, with high quality contributions from our side is better.&#x20;

| Criteria                                    | Questions to ask                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **1. Financial viability**                 | <p>Is the gig paid? </p><p>Is it in a location you need to go anyways and can cover your travel expenses to get there? </p>                                                                                                                                |
| **2. Topical & strategic aligment**         | <p>How aligned are the topics and audience of the event with our current focus? Will you be able to learn something new on subjects that are in the current focus?</p><p>Will you be able to meet people that are strategic for your current projects?</p> |
| **3. Stategic relationships**               | Is it strategic to build a good relationship with the organization running the event, because we want to partner in the future or want to support the mission?                                                                                             |
| **4. PR & Visibility**                      | Are we currently actively trying to promote something this will give us an opportunity for? How big will the audience be /are talks being filmed or streamed?                                                                                              |
| **5. Logistics & footprint**                | How complicated will it be to get there (how much of your energy will it take)? If it's a far trip, can you connect it with other things? Is the opportunity worth the enviromental footprint?                                                             |
