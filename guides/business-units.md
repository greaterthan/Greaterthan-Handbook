## Business Units

From a financial perspective, Greaterthan is structured into business units, which are managed as independent entities inside the organization.&#x20;

### Types of business units

There are several types of BUs:&#x20;

* **Personal BUs** for people working through the business
* **Project BUs,** which are for large consulting projects&#x20;
* **Shrubbery BUs,** which are projects that Greaterthan is investing in and/or operates separate from the core, i.e Cobudget, Academy, Better Work Together.
* **GT Core BU,** which holds all operating costs, consulting budgets and surplus (that is then paid out as bonuses or reinvested in projects).

### Who can have a personal business unit

Personal business units are for partners only, and for associates on a case by case basis.&#x20;

### Starting a new Business Unit

Personal business units can be created if the BU owner agrees to the following conditions (BU agreement):&#x20;

**#1 All work invoiced contributes 15 % to GT core**, to go towards admin overhead and the GT common pot for investing in new projects, as laid out in our financial agreement.

**#2 The BU is managed responsibly:**&#x20;

* the BU owner ensures they always have sufficient funds to cover incoming costs&#x20;
* the amount in the BU shall never be negative
* If funds remain in the BU after the year-end, the 19% UK company tax will automatically be deducted.&#x20;

To start a new BU for a Shrubbery, a proposal must be approved by consent in the GT member Loomio.
